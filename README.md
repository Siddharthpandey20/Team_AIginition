## Overview

DocuChat is an AI-powered chatbot designed to efficiently retrieve and process information from multiple data formats (PDFs, CSVs, voice files, images, and web links, including nested links). It leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to provide accurate and contextually relevant answers while ensuring transparency in retrieval, re-ranking, and final responses.

## Features

- âœ… **Multimodal Data Ingestion** - Supports PDFs (text/images/links), CSVs, audio files, images, and web links.
- âœ… **Automated Vector Database Updates** - Updates whenever a document is modified.
- âœ… **Efficient Retrieval & RAG Implementation** - Uses FAISS for vector storage and BM25 for keyword-based retrieval.
- âœ… **Transparent Query Responses** - Displays retrieved documents, re-ranking results, and final LLM-generated responses.
- âœ… **User-Friendly Interface** - Supports file uploads and URL-based ingestion.
- âœ… **API Support** - Exposes endpoints for programmatic access to RAG-based responses.
- âœ… **Secure & Scalable** - Implements security measures to prevent misinformation and hallucinations.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Node.js (for frontend development)
- pip and virtual environment

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/DocuChat.git
   cd DocuChat
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the backend server:
   ```sh
   python run.py
   ```
4. Access the frontend at:
   ```
   http://localhost:8000
   ```

---

## Usage

1. **Upload Documents**: Use the web interface to upload PDFs, CSVs, images, or audio files.
2. **Provide URLs**: Enter a website URL, and the chatbot will extract data automatically.
3. **Ask Questions**: Query the chatbot to retrieve and generate relevant responses.
4. **Monitor Processing**: The system updates the vector database automatically upon document modifications.

## How We Solved PS 2

The problem statement required a chatbot capable of retrieving and processing multimodal documents while ensuring transparency and security. We achieved this by:

âœ… **Data Ingestion & Preprocessing**

- Extracted text from PDFs, CSVs, images (OCR), audio (Whisper), and web links.
- Parsed and structured extracted content for vector database storage.

âœ… **Vector Database & RAG Implementation**

- Utilized FAISS for vector storage.
- Implemented a hybrid search combining BM25 (keyword search) and FAISS (semantic search).
- Ensured automatic vector database updates when documents changed.

âœ… **Retrieval Transparency & Explainability**

- Displayed retrieved documents, re-ranking details, and final chatbot-generated responses.

âœ… **User Interaction & UI/UX**

- Developed an intuitive frontend for document upload and chatbot interaction.
- Allowed users to create and manage multiple document collections.

âœ… **API & Integration Support**

- Provided API endpoints for external applications to query the chatbot programmatically.

âœ… **Security & Guardrails**

- Implemented safeguards against hallucinations, misinformation, and security vulnerabilities.
- Ensured safe document handling and data privacy.
